# Decision Log

This file owns decisions made during execution (see `AGENTS.md`). Entries are
append-only: never rewrite or remove a past entry, only add new ones below it.

## 2026-09-10 — Storage topology decision (TC-004, REQ-G0-006)
Decision: **embedded** (in-process index) for product pdf/net.
Measured via `foss_mcp.indexing.topology_spike`, one common interface, 15-doc fixture corpus, 30 labelled queries, top_k=5:
embedded p95=0.058ms relevance=1.00 (30/30); service_shaped p95=0.692ms relevance=1.00 (30/30).
Rule (plan 18.1): keep the smaller-footprint profile (embedded) unless relevance is >10% worse or p95 is >2x the other's; neither held (0% relevance gap, 0.08x p95 ratio), so embedded is chosen.

## 2026-09-10 — Repo-wide lint was not gated by any card (supervisor note)
Gap: card checks gate acceptance, but no card required repo-wide `ruff check`/`format`,
so worker-written `src/` drifted style-wise while every card stayed green.
This is the "checks quietly stop running" failure mode the design cites (RC5/S5).
Applied now: `ruff check --fix` + `ruff format` — tool-applied, no semantic change; 117 tests
pass before and after. Structural fix for G1: repo-wide lint/format joins the gate-exit criteria
rather than relying on any card to remember it.
